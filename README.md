# Devops-Projects
Hey! I have been using NextWork Projects to learn about AWS services and other Devops tools, in this repository I will be uploading the documentation of my projects and what I learnt while doing them.
AWS services like EC2, IAM, Secrets Manager, S3, Amazon Quicksight, and other related topics like Docker, VS Code, Github, SSH, JAVA, JSON required in Devops.
The Documentations include screenshots of my AWS Console and also detailed explanation of all the topics and methods used.
